              <h2>The Russian Revolution and Civil War</h2>
                  <p> This is a research paper I wrote during my freshman year. After the fall of the Tsar Nicholas, 
                  the rise of the peoples revoultion of 1917, and the growth of the Bolshevik party, a conflict of power occured. This was between the 
                  traditionalists Whites, and the radical Reds or the Bolsheviks and Lenin. Later this became known as the Russian Civil War 
                  and is what solidified Lenin and the Bolshevik party's authority. <br><br>

                  <p>For my Historians Craft course we had to compare and contrast two pieces of media on how they represented a historical period or event.
                  In this essay I compared the award-winning film Gone With the Wind and popular YouTube videos Crash Course narrated by John Green on the Civil War.<br><br>

              <h3>Reflection</h3>
            
              <p>Working with others is something that exists in any workplace. Whether it is with fellow employees, bosses, or clients, being able to communicate and work with one another is an essential skill to possess. By working with my team efficiently, we were able to create a site for our client, Arkansas Interfaith Power and Light. <br><br>
	Our team initially organized ourselves by delegating certain roles. We nominated Kayla as our leader, Zach as the head developer, Brian co-developer and troubleshooter, and I as a designer and content organizer. One of my roles in the project was finding out what feel and style the client wanted to have for the site. She gave feedback that she wanted the site to be updated, yet still be traditional and simple. I also gained approval from the client for the main color scheme to be green. Another task that I had was marking up the content on WordPress. While Zach and Brian were the ones to transfer the content, I went in to divide it up to increase readability. To do this I used lists, headers, and images. Overall, while we all had our specific tasks, I felt we were very collaborative on many elements of the site.<br><br>
	The greatest challenge during this project was working with WordPress itself. There were many times when we wanted to change something, but it worked against the theme we chose. This issue taught us all how important it is to choose a theme not just for its look, but how it needs to be used, changed, or programmed. To work through this challenge, we practiced trial and error as well as adjusted our approach for what we were wanting. <br><br>
	The experience of working as a group taught me that everyone works differently. Some members preferred to work together or communicate more than others, even though everyone was involved. I also learned how working with other people can help you gain new skills. While most of us were mostly unfamiliar with WordPress, the more we all played around with it, the better we could help each other if an issue arose. <br><br>
	If I had the opportunity to do this project over again, I would probably do a couple of things. First, I would educate myself better on WordPress, plugins, widgets, amongst other elements. I think if we spent the time learning how the platform worked on creating the site, it would have been even better. I also would probably choose a different theme. While the client did like the look of this theme, there were countless times that we struggled because our vision for a certain element on the site worked against it. However, I think with the time and experience we had that we did a good job, and our client was pleased with the results.
